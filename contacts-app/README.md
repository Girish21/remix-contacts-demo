# Remix

Welcome to this tutorial on Remix. We're going to build a small contact management app. This tutorial is designed to get familiar with various APIs and conventions of Remix.

> **This tutorial is written in TypeScript. If you are not familiar with TypeScript, you can remove all the TypeScript type definitions and rename all files from `tsx` to `jsx`, and everything will work**

## Setup

Remix requires Node version 14 or greater.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Girish21/remix-contacts-demo.git
cd remix-contacts-demo/contacts-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Remix runs on port 3000 by default. Once the development server is ready, you can visit the app on `http://localhost:3000`.

_If you face any issues with the `remix` package, check if the `postinstall` npm script has run_
